**Quiz Website Development Plan**

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Set up a new React project using `create-react-app`.
    *   Create the basic file structure for components, styles, and quiz data.

2.  **Quiz Data:**
    *   Create a JSON file (`questions.json`) to store the quiz questions and answers. Each question object should have:
        *   `question`: The question text.
        *   `options`: An array of answer options.
        *   `correctAnswer`: The correct answer.
*   Populate `questions.json` with at least 5 diverse questions.
3.  **Components:**
    *   **`App` component:** The main component that will manage the quiz state (current question, score, etc.).
    *   **`Question` component:** Displays the current question and answer options.
    *   **`Answer` component:** Represents a single answer option.
    *   **`Result` component:** Displays the final score and a "Restart Quiz" button.

4.  **Styling:**
    *   Use CSS to style the quiz components for a clean and user-friendly interface.
    *   Create a main stylesheet (`App.css`) and potentially separate stylesheets for each component.

5.  **Functionality:**
    *   Load the quiz data from `questions.json`.
    *   Display one question at a time.
    *   Handle user clicks on answer options.
    *   Check if the selected answer is correct and update the score.
    *   Move to the next question after an answer is selected.
    *   Display the final result when all questions have been answered.
    *   Implement a "Restart Quiz" functionality.

6.  **Deployment:**
    *   Since it's a client-side only application, it can be deployed to any static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
