**Pseudocode for Quiz Website**

**1. Data Structure (questions.json)**

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
    "correctAnswer": "Paris"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 2 + 2?",
    "options": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    "correctAnswer": "4"
  }
]
```

**2. App Component (App.js)**

```javascript
Component App
  State:
    questions = []
    currentQuestionIndex = 0
    score = 0
    quizEnded = false

  Lifecycle (on mount):
    Fetch questions from "questions.json"
    Set questions state

  Function handleAnswer(selectedAnswer):
    correctAnswer = questions[currentQuestionIndex].correctAnswer
    If selectedAnswer is equal to correctAnswer:
      Increment score
    
    nextQuestionIndex = currentQuestionIndex + 1
    If nextQuestionIndex is less than questions.length:
      Set currentQuestionIndex to nextQuestionIndex
    Else:
      Set quizEnded to true

  Function restartQuiz():
    Set currentQuestionIndex to 0
    Set score to 0
    Set quizEnded to false

  Render:
    If quizEnded is true:
      Render Result component with score, totalQuestions, and restartQuiz function
    Else if questions array is not empty:
      Render Question component with questions[currentQuestionIndex] and handleAnswer function
    Else:
      Render "Loading..."
```

**3. Question Component (Question.js)**

```javascript
Component Question(question, onAnswer)
  Render:
    Display question.question text
    For each option in question.options:
      Render Answer component with option and onAnswer function
```

**4. Answer Component (Answer.js)**

```javascript
Component Answer(option, onAnswer)
  Render:
    Button with text option
    On click, call onAnswer(option)
```

**5. Result Component (Result.js)**

```javascript
Component Result(score, totalQuestions, onRestart)
  Render:
    Display "Your score: " + score + " / " + totalQuestions
    Button with text "Restart Quiz"
    On click, call onRestart()
